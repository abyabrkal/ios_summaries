## Conditional operators

Example conditional operators:

    Comparison:

    equality:  valueA == valueB
    inequality: valueA != valueB
    greater than: valueA > valueB
    equal or greater than: valueA > valueB
    less than: valueA < valueB
    equal or less than: valueA <= valueB

    Ternary:

    valueA == valueB ? someStuffWhenTrue : someStuffWhenFalse

    NOT-operator:

    var boolean = true
    boolean = !boolean
    boolean // false

    AND-operator:

    var bothTrue = someCondition && someOthercondition

    OR-operator:

    var oneTrue = someCondition || someOthercondition



## Arithmetic operators

Example arithmetic operators:

    Basic arithmetic:

    addition: 1 + 1
    subtraction: 1 - 1
    multiplication: 2 * 2
    division: 2 / 2

    Compound assignment operators:

    addition: += 1
    subtraction: -= 1
    multiplication: \*= 2
    division: /= 2

    Remainder:

    var number = 3
    number % 3 = 0
    number % 2 = 1
